Dynamath Hybrid

Dynamath Hybrid — an experimental platform for mixed Tensor + Quantum computing.
The project is structured into several layers:
	•	core for tensor computations (JAX/PyTorch)
	•	quantum for quantum circuits (Qiskit/Cirq)
	•	hybrid for bridges between them
	•	viz for visualization
	•	spec for data format and API specifications
